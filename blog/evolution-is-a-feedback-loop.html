            <h1>Evolution is a Feedback Loop</h1>
            <p>Cells are known as <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/04%3A_Cell_Structure/4.01%3A_Studying_Cells_-_Cells_as_the_Basic_Unit_of_Life#:~:text=Cells%20as%20Building%20Blocks,building%20blocks%20of%20all%20organisms." target="_blank"><em>the building blocks of life</em></a>. All living things are composed of cells, and the human body has about 30 trillion (also known in scientific terms as “a lot”). These cells, almost miraculously, work together to allow us to think, breathe, eat, socialize, and navigate the world around us.</p>

            <p>The human body — our network of cells and genes — has evolved over billions of years, through the same processes governing the evolution of trees and flowers and rabbits and bees.</p>
            <p>Evolution is a feedback loop. Genes evolve through mutation, variation, and selection over successive iterations — what we might call “trial and error.” The genes most effective at replicating have a higher chance of being passed on to the next generation. </p>
            <p> We humans have an amazing ability to analyze and think about nature in this way. And we now know more about nature than we ever have before. But ironically, we have developed a 
    <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_modern_life_became_disconnected_from_nature" target="_blank">
        tendency to feel separate from nature
    </a>. <em>Nature is out there, and we are here, inside our bodies, or inside our heads.</em>
</p>
            <p><p>
    Humanity’s disconnection from nature may come as no surprise, considering, for example, 
    trends in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db513.htm" target="_blank">screen time usage</a> 
    or <a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-20-553/" target="_blank">time spent indoors</a>.
</p>
</p>
<p>But as a matter of fact, we are part of nature. </p>
            <p>Reflect for a moment on the statement, “You are one with the universe.” Such statements can come across as mystical or supernatural, and may indeed be used in unscientific contexts. But human beings are a natural phenomenon, just like a peach tree or a lilac. And we can feel connected with nature when we go outside for a hike, tend to the garden, watch the sunset, or admire bees gathering pollen from flowers.</p>
            <p><p>
    However, these sorts of nature-connection activities are growing increasingly rare, and our society’s disconnection from nature poses a problem, because we are facing an

        urgent climate crisis
    </a>.
</p>
</p>
            <p>Crises demand solutions. We need sustainable climate solutions which promote planetary resilience, boost human health and well-being, and bolster economies. </p>
            <p>We can achieve this through what might be called <em>social-ecological feedback loops.</em> </p>
