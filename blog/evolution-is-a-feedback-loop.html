            <h1>Evolution is a Feedback Loop</h1>

            <p>
                Cells are known as <a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/04%3A_Cell_Structure/4.01%3A_Studying_Cells_-_Cells_as_the_Basic_Unit_of_Life#:~:text=Cells%20as%20Building%20Blocks,building%20blocks%20of%20all%20organisms." target="_blank"><em>the building blocks of life</em></a>. 
                All living things are composed of cells, and the human body has about 30 trillion (also known in scientific terms as “a lot”). 
                These cells, almost miraculously, work together to allow us to think, breathe, eat, socialize, and navigate the world around us.
            </p>

            <p>
                The human body — our network of cells and genes — has evolved over billions of years, through the same processes governing the evolution of trees and flowers and rabbits and bees.
            </p>

            <p>
                Evolution is a feedback loop. Genes evolve through mutation, variation, and selection over successive iterations — what we might call “trial and error.” 
                The genes most effective at replicating have a higher chance of being passed on to the next generation.
            </p>

            <p>
                We humans have an amazing ability to analyze and think about nature in this way. And we now know more about nature than we ever have before. 
                But ironically, we have developed a <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_modern_life_became_disconnected_from_nature" target="_blank">tendency to feel separate from nature</a>. 
                <em>Nature is out there, and we are here, inside our bodies, or inside our heads.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Humanity’s disconnection from nature may come as no surprise, considering, for example, 
                trends in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db513.htm" target="_blank">screen time usage</a> 
                or <a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-20-553/" target="_blank">time spent indoors</a>.
            </p>

            <p>But as a matter of fact, we are part of nature.</p>

            <p>
                Reflect for a moment on the statement, “You are one with the universe.” Such statements can come across as mystical or supernatural, 
                and may indeed be used in unscientific contexts. But human beings are a natural phenomenon, just like a peach tree or a lilac. 
                And we can feel connected with nature when we go outside for a hike, tend to the garden, watch the sunset, or admire bees gathering pollen from flowers.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, these sorts of nature-connection activities are growing increasingly rare, and our society’s disconnection from nature poses a problem, 
                because we are facing an <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/climate-change#:~:text=Climate%20change%20is%20impacting%20human,of%20progress%20in%20global%20health" target="_blank">urgent climate crisis</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Crises demand solutions. We need sustainable climate solutions which promote planetary resilience, boost human health and well-being, and bolster economies.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can achieve this through what might be called <em>social-ecological feedback loops</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Take a look at the <a href="https://www.unicef.org/media/135011/file/Global%20multisectoral%20operational%20framework.pdf" target="_blank">Social-Ecological Model</a>, 
                a theoretical framework for conceptualizing different “layers” of human systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s break this graphic down: The social-ecological model depicts systems nested within one another. In the center we have an individual. 
                The individual exists within small groups such as families. Individuals and families form communities — schools, work teams, chess clubs, concert-goers, and so on. 
                These communities culminate in societies: towns, cities, and nations, all with unique cultures and norms. 
                In the outermost layer we have policies and systems: abstract ideas governing possibilities and limits for the inner layers.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a new policy is implemented — in our governments, our companies, our schools, our families, and so on — what happens? 
                Its effects ripple out into all individuals under its “umbrella.” When something affects an individual, that means literally impacting the cells in their body and brain. 
                In this way, policies and systems, even though they are abstract knowledge documented in books and files and pages and bits, have effects at the cellular level. 
                But unless we work with microscopes, we don’t see the cells changing. What we <em>do</em> perceive, however, are changes in behavior and thought.
            </p>

            <p>
                Changes in people cause changes in families, communities, and societies. These changes gradually lead to different ways of thinking and behaving, 
                resulting in new ideas for improving policies and systems. And the cycle continues. This mechanism drives human progress.
            </p>

            <p>
                What I’m describing is a feedback loop of problem solving through variation and selection over successive iterations. Trial and error.
            </p>

            <p>
                In other words, this is evolution — but of ideas rather than genes. And the evolution of ideas can happen at much more rapid timescales than biological evolution, 
                because we don’t need to wait a generation to activate the feedback loop. An idea can evolve many times even within a day.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the spirit of practical application, let’s work through a concrete example of this feedback loop in action.
            </p>

            <p>
                A company implements a new policy: They will reimburse every employee up to $100 spent on plants in the office (or if they work from home, $100 on plants for their homes). 
                Employees are encouraged to purchase the plants from local shops and to care for the plants collaboratively.
            </p>

            <p>
                The office begins to slowly fill with greenery. With time, the policy’s effects ripple out to all the employees. 
                They become <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4419447/" target="_blank">less stressed</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140901090735.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">more productive</a>, 
                and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10346441/" target="_blank">workplace satisfaction goes up</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We’ve got a classic example of a win-win situation. The office is now more beautiful and inviting, work is more pleasant, and the company’s output goes up. 
                The economy benefits from money spent at local plant shops, and people enjoy a sense of satisfaction from obtaining new skills around caring for plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                After one year, let’s say the company collects feedback on the office plants initiative and learns that there are certain aspects to improve upon. 
                For example, some plants die too easily in that particular space due to sunlight or temperature needs, so they send out a memo suggesting a narrower range of species. 
                They also decide to form a partnership with a plant shop just around the corner.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through successive iterations, the program evolves. Just as it’s impossible to predict how biological evolution will unfold, it’s impossible to predict what would happen after, say, a decade of this policy. 
                Maybe the result is <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/general-design-every-day-is-the-day-office-tokyo-japan-02-19-2018/" target="_blank">an office filled with plants</a>, 
                or a community garden on the roof of the building. Maybe the new partnership allows the plant shop to open a second location. 
                Maybe the company works with the local governments or media to promote green initiatives. Much could, and would, happen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Would this company’s plant initiative “solve” climate change? No, but it would make a small contribution. Evolution is a feedback loop. Small changes lead to big changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The challenge is to decide what changes to implement in the workplace, in our governments, in our schools, in our families, and in our own lives. 
                Building parks and gardens? Learning and enhancing <a href="https://www.aimhi.earth/blog/what-are-green-skills-15-green-skills-clearly-explained" target="_blank">green skills</a>? 
                Facilitating education and training programs? Promoting long-term sustainability objectives? Buying plants? Perhaps all of the above, and then some.
            </p>

            <p>
                Research plays a key role in addressing this challenge of knowing what to do, because research evaluates what works and what needs improved or discarded. 
                The information gathered from research feeds back into the system, informing the next iteration of the evolutionary cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humans are natural phenomena. We can solve climate change, not just through reconnecting with nature, but through positively impacting all levels of systems — from our cells to our policies.
